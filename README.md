This is a project I'm developing in my spare time.

It is a first person shooter developed in Unity.

The central conceit of the game is that it is set aboard a spaceship. Features this entails are dynamic "gravity" (as induced by the thrust of the spaceship), as well as vacuums
and pressurized areas. These features and scenarios are inspired by the series *The Expanse* by James S. A. Corey.

Currently the project is very uncomplete and barebones. I am teaching myself Unity as well as C# as I go.
